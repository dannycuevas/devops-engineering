ðŸš€Kubernetes Scaling Strategies ðŸ‘‡  
  
Each scaling strategy offers a unique approach to efficiently manage resources and ensure optimal performance:  
  
[1] Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):  
Automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics.  
  
[2] Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA):  
Automatically adjusts the CPU and memory resources allocated to pods in a deployment or replica set.  
  
[3] Cluster Autoscaling:  
Dynamically adjusts the number of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster based on the demands of the workloads and resource availability.  
  
[4] Manual Scaling:  
Involves manually setting the number of replicas in a deployment or replica set, using a command like $ kubectl scale --replicas=desired_replica_count object_type/object_name.  
  
[5] Predictive Scaling:  
Uses advanced algorithms and AI, like in PredictKube, to forecast future demand and proactively scale resources before they are needed.  
  
[6] Custom Metrics Based Scaling:  
Scales pods based on custom metrics provided by Kubernetes metrics APIs, beyond the default CPU and memory metrics.
