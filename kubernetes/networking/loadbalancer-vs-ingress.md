🚀 Load Balancer vs. Ingress Controller in Kubernetes – What’s the Difference? 🤔  
  
When exposing applications in Kubernetes, should you use a Load Balancer or an Ingress Controller?  
🔀 Both handle traffic, but choosing the right one impacts scalability, cost, and security!  
  
🔀 Load Balancer (L4 - Network Layer)  
  
A Load Balancer distributes external traffic to Kubernetes services at the network layer (L4 – TCP/UDP). Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provision external load balancers when a Service type is set to LoadBalancer.  
  
When to Use a Load Balancer?  
✔️ When you need to expose a single service directly to the internet.  
✔️ For external traffic distribution with minimal setup.  
✔️ If you need low-latency load balancing at the network level.  
  
Benefit 👇  
✔️ Simple to configure – just define a Service as LoadBalancer.  
✔️ Efficient traffic routing at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP).  
✔️ Cloud-managed (AWS ELB, Azure LB, GCP LB).  
  
🔀 Ingress Controller (L7 - Application Layer)  
  
An Ingress Controller manages HTTP(S) traffic at the application layer (L7), routing requests based on hostnames, paths, and SSL/TLS termination. It exposes multiple services via a single entry point using an Ingress resource.  
  
When to Use an Ingress Controller?  
✔️ When you need to expose multiple services under a single external IP.  
✔️ For host/path-based routing (e.g., [api.example.com](http://api.example.com/) → Service A, [web.example.com](http://web.example.com/) → Service B).  
✔️ If you need TLS termination, rate limiting, and authentication.  
  
Benefit 👇  
✔️ Consolidates traffic through one IP → Cost-effective.  
✔️ Supports advanced routing (host, path, and header-based).  
✔️ TLS termination & security features (authentication, rate-limiting).
