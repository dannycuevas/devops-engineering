- Documenting my own DevOps journey, pursuing my passion, and my projects

- If any doubts, or just want to collaborate with me, just contact me via
linkedin or here, it would be nice to see this project grow and reach out and
help people get into the realm of DevOps (: 

- So... ALL COLLABORATION is most welcome (: 

See you in the grid!


PS: Every single note here was "hand written" (typed in lol) by me so far,
following videos, projects, or courses, no copy paste from other text sources.
